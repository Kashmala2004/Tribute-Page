          <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
          <p>Nelson Mandela was born on <strong>July 18, 1918,</strong> in the small village of Mvezo in South Africa. He belonged to the Thembu royal family. As a child, he attended local Methodist schools and later studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand.</p>

          <h2>Anti-Apartheid Activism</h2>
          <p>In <strong>1944,</strong> Mandela joined the African National Congress (ANC) and co-founded its Youth League. He quickly became a key figure in the fight against apartheid — the system of racial segregation in South Africa.

          He led peaceful protests, defied unjust laws, and even organized national strikes. But as the government’s oppression grew, Mandela began advocating for armed resistance.</p>
